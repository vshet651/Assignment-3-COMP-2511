            <p>
                I was volunteering at my local temple when I was in grade 6 to grade 8. On the weekends, I would serve people food and clean up the temple and food hall.
                There would be around 100 to 150 people that would come every Saturday and Sunday for the food and to pray at the temple. Once my high school started
                I learned I couldn't hold down two volunteering gigs so I had to decide to cut this one.

                I was a student at Kumon, which was a learning center to help me improve my math and Language Arts skills. Here after I would
                To finish my own work, I would help the staff by marking other students' books, helping them or organizing paperwork in the back.
                These skills I learned here of time management, organization, and independent working helped me get my future jobs. Once the Covid-19 pandemic hit
                I was at the point of finishing the program and I did in August 2020. Because I didn't have transportation to get there the volunteering had to stop, and with the
                Covid-19 Pandemic they didn't have many people volunteering.

                With Covid shutting most things down, and the cost of everything going up, I decided to give back to my community and city.
                By volunteering at the Calgary Food Bank, by organizing and giving people in need food boxes. As everyone was going through a hard time. 
                I was thankful for what I was priveleged with, so giving back to my city was important to me during this hard time.

            <p>
                This was my first-ever job, as the Subway I was working at was my uncle's. It was only a summer job, as I didn't want to sit at home 
                and do nothing in the summer, instead I worked with him, learning how to organize stock, order stock, create great customer experiences, 
                learn how to do tasks efficiently and many more things. Once my grade 12 year started in high school, I wanted to focus on school so I decided
                I didn't want to work while in school.

                This was my first job that I have kept long term. I have learned a lot from this job, as I have worked in many departments in the store I work at.
                But my main position is in the warehouse, where I do stock counts, break and put down our truck, fulfill online orders, while helping customers with
                their questions on the floor. I have made many of my closest friendships at this job and learned some important skills that I will take forward, to my future
                jobs once I graduate with my degree from Mount Royal University. But because of changes in culture and values at this location, I decided to put my resignation in.

            <p>
                This was my second job in 2024, where I was a key holder and cashier at a local Calgary liquor store in jacksonport
                It taught me new responsibilites in many ways, of ordering inventory, counting inverntory, closing and opening duties dealing with cash. 
                Even though my time here was short, as I was laid off because of financial reasons of the liquor store, it was great time and experience working here.
