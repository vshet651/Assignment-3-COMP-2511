            <h4>Hindu Temple Of Calgary 2017-2019</h4>
            <p>I was volunteering at my local temple when I was in grade 6 to grade 8. Where on the weekends, I would serve people food and clean up the temple and food hall.
                There would be around 100 to 150 people that would come every saturday and sunday for the food and to pray at the temple. Once my high school started 
                I learned I couldn't hold down two volunteering gigs so I had to decide to cut this one.

            <h4>Kumon 2018-2020</h4>
            <p>I was a student at Kumon, which was a learning center to help me improve my math and Language Arts skills. Here after I would 
                finish my own work, I would help the staff by marking other students books, helping them or be organzing paper work in the back. 
                These skills I learned here of time management, organization and independent working helped me get my future jobs. Once the Covid-19 panademic hit 
                I was at the point of finshing the program and I did in August 2020. Because I didn't have transportation to get there the volunteering had to stop, and with the 
                Covid-19 Panadmeic they didn't many people volunteering.

            <h4>Subway July 2021-September 2021</h4>
            <p>This was first ever job, as the Subway I was working at was my uncles. It was only a summer job, as I didn't want to sit at home 
                and do nothing in the summer, instead I worked with him, learning how to organize stock, order stock, create great customer expiernces, 
                learn how to do tasks efficently and many more things. Once my grade 12 year started in high school, I wanted to focus on school so I decided
                I didn't want to work while in school.

            <h4>Best Buy October 2022-Current</h4>
            <p>This was my first job that I have kept long term. I have learned a lot this job, as I have worked in many departments in the store I work at.
                But my main position is in the warehouse, where I do stock counts, break and put down our truck, fufill online orders, while helping customers with
                there questions on the floor. I have made many of closest friendships at this job and learned some important skills that I will take forward, to my future
                jobs once I graduate with my degree from Mount Royal University.
