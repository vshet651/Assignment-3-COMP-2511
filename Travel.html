            <h4>Trip 1:United Kingdom</h4>
            <p>
                My first trip was to the United Kingdom. As I have many family members in the UK from London, to Lecister, to Liverpool and Manchester.
                This was the first time our family as a whole stepped out of the country together, to go visit family and do sight seeing in London. Beside us
                we can picture of me in the liverpool jersey and my brother in the Chelesa jersey inside my aunt's home in Chigwell, UK.

            <p>
                My fourth trip out of the country with my family was to my home country of India. I was always wanting to go before this but never got a chance. 
                But during Grade 9 winter break, me and my family booked a trip to India, where I spent Christmas and New Years. I met and got to catch up with family 
                that I had never meet, and it was great meeting them all. Plus, it gave me huge eye open to how much different life is in India compared to Canada. The picture here 
                is a photo of me, my mom, my dad, my grandpa and my aunt and uncles.

            <h4>Trip 10:Vancouver</h4>
            <p>
                Even though we went to Vancover just in the summer, me and my three brother had to go back. This time it was for a concert, and the artist was Travis Scott.
                He is a famous hip hop artist, and was coming to perform his music at Rogers Arena. We all together had a great time, with us exploring the city and the suburbs beside it. When 
                we went to the concert, it was a night we would never forget, as it was a once in a life time experience. This was the first time us four had travelled alone, without our parents. And 
                it was experience we learned a lot from.
