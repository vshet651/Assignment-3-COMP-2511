            <h4>Trip 1:United Kingdom</h4>
            <p>
                My first trip was to the United Kingdom. As I have many family members in the UK from London, to Lecister, to Liverpool and Manchester.
                This was the first time our family as a whole stepped out of the country together, to go visit family and do sightseeing in London. Beside us
                We can picture of me in the Liverpool jersey and my brother in the Chelesa jersey inside my aunt's home in Chigwell, UK.

            <p> 
                This was the second trip that me and my family took outside of the country. This time we went for a trip around Europe, where we visited the UK again, France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Italy,
                Spain and Portugal. We took a tour bus company that took us around in a bus and ferries around Europe. It was mostly doing sightseeing and visiting important monuments in each
                country. The best part of this trip I remember is visiting DisneyLand in Paris. And on the right is a picture of me, my dad and my brother on ferry in France.

            <h4>Trip 3:Southern United States</h4>
            <p>
                The next trip me, my mom and my brother took was to the Southern United States, which was mainly Georgia and Florida. We went to Georgia for a
                my family's wedding, then after we went down to Florida and went to Orlando. Where we visited Disney World and Universal Studios. After we went to Tampa Bay
                , where I went to a huge theme park. It was a great trip and this was the first time I visited the US. The image here is a photo with my cousins, aunt, my mom, my brother and me.

            <h4>Trip 4:India</h4>
            <p>
                My fourth trip out of the country with my family was to my home country of India. I was always wanting to go before this but never got a chance.
                But during Grade 9 winter break, me and my family booked a trip to India, where I spent Christmas and New Years. I met and got to catch up with family
                that I had never met, and it was great meeting them all. Plus, it gave me a huge eye opening to how much different life is in India compared to Canada. The picture here
                is a photo of me, my mom, my dad, my grandpa and my aunt and uncles.

            <h4>Trip 10:Vancouver</h4>
            <p>
                Even though we went to Vancouver just in the summer, me and my three brothers had to go back. This time it was for a concert, and the artist was Travis Scott.
                He is a famous hip hop artist, and was coming to perform his music at Rogers Arena. We all together had a great time, with us exploring the city and the suburbs beside it. When
                we went to the concert, it was a night we would never forget, as it was a once in a lifetime experience. This was the first time us four had traveled alone, without our parents. And
                It was an experience we learned a lot from.
