            <h4>Trip 1: Family United Kingdom Trip</h4>
            <p>
                My first trip was to the United Kingdom. As I have many family members in the UK from London, to Lecister, to Liverpool and Manchester.
                This was the first time our family as a whole stepped out of the country together, to go visit family and do sightseeing in London. Beside us
                We can picture of me in the Liverpool jersey and my brother in the Chelesa jersey inside my aunt's home in Chigwell, UK.

                Spain and Portugal. We took a tour bus company that took us around in a bus and ferries around Europe. It was mostly doing sightseeing and visiting important monuments in each
                country. The best part of this trip I remember is visiting DisneyLand in Paris. And on the right is a picture of me, my dad and my brother on ferry in France.

                I don't remeber much from the trip, but my parents do tell me it was great time reuniting with the family and travelling with them.

                that I had never met, and it was great meeting them all. Plus, it gave me a huge eye opening to how much different life is in India compared to Canada. The picture here
                is a photo of me, my mom, my dad, my grandpa and my aunt and uncles.

                He is a famous hip hop artist, and was coming to perform his music at Rogers Arena. We all together had a great time, with us exploring the city and the suburbs beside it. When
                we went to the concert, it was a night we would never forget, as it was a once in a lifetime experience. This was the first time us four had traveled alone, without our parents. And
                It was an experience we learned a lot from.

            <p>
                This was one of dream trips, that I got to compelete this past fall 2024. I got visit and explore Melbourne Australia.
                First the reason I was going was to visit my brother who is studying there, and a concert for an artist called The Weeknd. 
                Even though the flight was long, and travel was hard. It was all worth it in the end, seeing my brother once again and being able to 
                see my favourite singer perform live. There was lots to do Melbourne, like many vintage stores, beaches, food places and the people are a lot of fun too. 
                Overall this was my favourite trip ever.
