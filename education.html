            <h4>North Haven Elementary School</h4>
            <p>From Kindergarten to Grade 6. I went to a school in Calgary called North Haven Elementary School located in North West Calgary.
                Here I made some great memories, with going of field trips, sports events and school events. Throughput the 7 years I was here, I made
                some of closet friends, that I still am friends with to this day.

            <h4>John G Diefenbaker High School</h4>
            <p>I attended High School at John G Diefenbaker. To be honest High School was werid time forme. As throughout high school I was hit with the pandemic,
                up until Semester 2 of Grade 12. Until then the Covid-19 pandemic took over my high school experience, with some of it being online and some in person. 
                In grade 12 some things did become normal, and I did have a great time in grade 12, making new friends and great memories. But in general high school was 
                remembered as the COVID years.

            <h4>Chinook Learning Services</h4>
            <p>I took a year of school and for one semester, I felt liked I had to upgrade one of my classes which was Biology 30. As I did finish the class with a 83.
                But I didn't think that was good enough for uni. So I went back CLS which is James Fowler High School and upgraded there for a semester.

            <h4>Mount Royal Unvieristy</h4>
            <p>Currently I am attending Mount Royal Unviersity, taking a degree in Computer Information Systems. It was at first hard to adjust from the high school 
                work load to the university work load. But after a couple months, I was use to it, but that dosen't mean it has been eazy. It has still been hard, with uni having its 
                ups and downs. But one thing I have learned that I didn't really use in High School is learn from your mistakes and see how to fix them, instead of sulking over you getting
                a bad grade.
